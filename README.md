## Input

The service offers a RESTful API endpoint, allowing users to submit Excel files containing metadata to be validated.

## Process

Uploaded Excel files are transformed into a suitable format before undergoing validation against the [Lectern](https://github.com/overture-stack/lectern) dictionary. The validation logic is powered by the dedicated team behind Lectern and is available as an npm package, [lectern-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overturebio-stack/lectern-client).

## Output

Upon completion, the service generates a detailed JSON report, highlighting any errors detected during the validation process.

### Possible errors

#### Value error
The field only accepts values from a restricted list and the current value does not match any of the allowed values.

#### Invalid format
The field's value does not comply with the defined regular expression pattern.

#### Missing required field
The field is required but the current value is empty/null.

#### Unrecognized field
The submitted data has a field which is not in the schema.

## Technology Stack

- Node.js 18.4.0
- TypeScript 4.4.3
- Express.js 4.16.1

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository
Clone this repository using `git clone`.

### Mongo DB and Lectern
This validator needs a Mongo db and an instance of Lectern.

#### Mongo DB setup
You can use the file `docker-compose.yaml` to start a docker container with a mongo db, which is useful for development purposes. 
`docker-compose up -d`.

If you use this container, the Mongo instance will be listening on the port 27272 of the host machine.

#### Lectern setup
You can read the documentation at https://github.com/overture-stack/lectern to clone the code and start the service. An important part of the setup is to create a suitable `.env` where you set the credentials to connect to the Mongo db.


### Install project dependencies
Install project dependencies by running `yarn install`.

## Usage

Start the server using the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```
